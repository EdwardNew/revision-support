            "We would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and valuable feedback. We greatly appreciate the time and effort put into reviewing our paper.",
        "Summary of Paper Contributions":
            "Our paper, Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), introduces an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts. Our experiments demonstrate that BoT achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.",
        "Responses to Reviewers Concerns": {
            "Incorporate Theoretical Insights": {
                "Highlight how findings build on established ML theories":
                    "We will address how our findings build on well-established ML theories and extend beyond practical applications of ML techniques. This distinction is critical in differentiating academic research from practical production.",
            },
            "Improve Figures and Examples": {
                "Enhance examples in figure 1":
                    "We will add more detailed examples to Figure 1 to improve the clarity and comprehensibility of the illustration.",
            },
            "Clarify Methodology": {
                "Discuss aggregation strategies and tree edge weights in appendix":
                    "We will include details on aggregation strategies and tree edge weights in the appendix, mentioning that these were previously left out for brevity.",
                "Simplify abstract and methodology with clear descriptions":
                    "We will revise the abstract and methodology sections to simplify explanations, using more straightforward language and clear, step-by-step descriptions of BoT's processes.",
                "Justify the small dataset in evaluation":
                    "We will address and justify the use of a small dataset for evaluation, explaining its relevance and limitations.",
                "Clarify model aggregation and thought improvement processes":
                    "We will clarify how the model aggregates and refines thoughts within the tree structure and how weaknesses in thoughts are identified and addressed.",
            },
            "Address Feedback Impact": {
                "Discuss effect of hallucinations on LLM feedback accuracy":
                    "We will discuss our analysis of the impact of hallucinations on LLM feedback accuracy, highlighting any potential issues arising from spurious feedback.",
                "Consider in-context learning for error analysis":
                    "We will look into the approach of considering the entire input and error analysis as an in-context learning example.",
                "Guidelines for stopping point in thought revision process":
                    "We will provide guidelines or steps to help determine an appropriate stopping point in the thought revision process, as over-revision can have adverse effects.",
            },
            "Expand Evaluation Domains": {
                "Test BoT on commonsense reasoning domains":
                    "We will explore testing BoT's performance on other domains such as commonsense reasoning or symbolic reasoning to demonstrate its generality.",
            },
